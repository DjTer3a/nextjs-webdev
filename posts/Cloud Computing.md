This is a topic that every aspiring web developer hears or reads about, and proceeds to freak out interally. It is shown in most blogs to be the most cutting-edge/important aspect of web development to learn. Cloud computing is a collection of very useful, and powerful tools. A quick google search returns "Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software". While, it might seem intimading at first once you get started with a tool like FireBase or learn the basics of AWS you get to know that basically you don't need to understand that much to get started with it.
