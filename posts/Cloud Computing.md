These are topics that every aspiring web developer hears or reads about and proceeds to freak out internally. It is shown in most blogs to be the most cutting-edge/important aspect of web development to learn. Cloud computing is a collection of handy and powerful tools. A quick google search returns, "Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software". While it might seem intimidating at first, once you get started with a tool like FireBase or learn the basics of AWS, you get to know that basically, you don't need to understand much of the technicalities to get started with it and can comfortably begin to use these powerful tools as a beginner just by watching one or two, ten minutes long youtube tutorials.
