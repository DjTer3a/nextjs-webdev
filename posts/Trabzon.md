Trabzon is one of the most magical places I have ever been to. The mountains and the sea emanated such an aura that made me feel at peace and at edge at the same time. While in Trabzon, I ventured into old ruins of lost civilizations, into ancient limestone caves carved by water over 3,000 years ago. I got to know more about Turkish Heritage and culture and enjoyed every single moment on the top of mountains, where you could look down and see the clouds under your feet. That experience is one of the most cherished memories I have, although my phone almost fell off a mountain.
