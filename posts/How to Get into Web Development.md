One of the most asked questions by everyone I meet. It is easy. You have to google a bit and be willing to learn. One of the first steps that you should stay away from is googling tech stacks and getting lost in technicalities that have no end and no goal. Instead, the best way to get started is by making a simple website. Nothing too complicated. One page, one purpose should be the motto and mindset while designing your first website. The tools I would recommend learning are as follows:

-  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) 
-  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
-  [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/)
-  [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
-  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

By knowing the basics of the above technologies/ frameworks, you should create many websites. Each technology has comprehensive and extensive documentation and guides to aid you in your development journey. Laracasts is one of my favorite resources to learn web development. Sending good vibes and wishing you the best of luck!
