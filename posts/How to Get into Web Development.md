One of the most asked questions by every one I meet. It is easy you just have to google a bit, and be willing to learn. One of the first steps that you should definitely stay away from is googling tech stacks, and getting lost in technachlities that have no end, and no goal. Instead the best way that I found to get started is by making a simple website. Nothing too complicated, one page, one purpose should be the motto and your mindset while desiging your first website. The tools I would recommend learning are as follows:

-  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) 
-  [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
-  [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/)
-  [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
-  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

By knowing the basics of the above technologies/ frameworks you should be able to create many websites. Each technology has comrehensive, and extensive doucumentation and guides to aid you in your development journey. Laracasts is one of my favourite resources to learn web development.
Sending all the good vibes and wishing you the best of luck!
