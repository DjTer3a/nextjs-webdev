Lately, I have been spending a lot of time alone, which led to me getting lost in my thoughts and provided me with a dive, albeit shallow, into my psyche. Connection is an essential human need, in my opinion. The urge to connect with other people, nature, and yourself can be so brutal sometimes on one's psyche. Consider this a public announcement that you are good enough, and as always, sending all the good vibes, and wish you the best of luck!
