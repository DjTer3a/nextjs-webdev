Lately, I have been spending a lot of time alone which led to me to get lost in my thoughts, and provided me with a dive albeit shallow into my physche. Connection is the most important human need in my opinion. The urge to connect with other people, nature, and yourself can be so brutal sometimes on one's physche. Consider this a public announcment that you are good enough, and as always sending all the good vibes and wishing you the best of luck!
